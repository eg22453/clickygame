# clickygame

A browser based game created with React/Javascript/Node.js. Each time a picture is clicked the picture tiles are shuffled. 
Don't click the same on twice or your game restarts!


## Motivation
This project was made in order to practice React.js and understand how components are re-rendered whenever the components 
state is changed.
